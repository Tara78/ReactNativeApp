#My React Native Goal Tracker App
Overview
This is a simple React Native application designed to help users track their goals. Users can add, edit, and delete goals in a straightforward manner.

#Features
Adding Goals
At the top of the application, there's an "Add New Goal" section where users can input their goals. Simply type your goal into the input box and tap the "Add" button to include it in the list.

Editing Goals
To edit a goal, press on the specific item in the list. This will allow you to modify the text of the goal.

Deleting Goals
Removing a goal from the list is easy. Just tap on the goal you want to delete, and it will be instantly removed from the list.

#Performance Optimization
I've utilized the FlatList component to enhance performance. This choice was made over ScrollView to ensure smoother scrolling and better memory management, especially when dealing with a potentially long list of goals.

##Technologies Used
.React Native
.UseState hook
